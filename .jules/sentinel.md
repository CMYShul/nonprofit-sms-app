## 2025-05-11 - Information Leakage and Lack of Input Validation in SMS API
**Vulnerability:** The `/api/send-sms` endpoint was leaking raw Twilio error messages to the client and lacked any validation on the number of recipients or message length.
**Learning:** API endpoints that interface with paid third-party services (like Twilio) are high-value targets for abuse. Without input limits, they can be used for DoS or to rack up large bills.
**Prevention:** Always implement strict input validation (length, count) and return generic error messages to the client while logging details internally.
